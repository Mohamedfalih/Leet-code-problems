The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
that is,
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).

SOURCE CODE:

int fib(int n)
{
    int prev=0,curr=1,next;
    if(n==1)
        return 1;
    if(n==0)
        return 0;
    for(int i=2;i<=n;i++)
    {
        next=prev+curr;
        prev=curr;
        curr=next;
    }
    return next;
}
OUTPUT:

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
Example 3:

Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
