You are given a string s and an integer k. Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:
For each character c in s, replace c with the kth character after c in the string (in a cyclic manner).
Return the encrypted string

SOURCE CODE:

char* getEncryptedString(char* s, int k)
{
    char *res=malloc(101);
    int n = strlen(s);
    if (k%n==0) 
    { 
        return s;
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) 
    {
        int z=(k+i)%n;
        res[i]=s[z];
    }
    res[n]=0;
    return res;
}

OUTPUT:
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "dart", k = 3
Output: "tdar"
Explanation:
For i = 0, the 3rd character after 'd' is 't'.
For i = 1, the 3rd character after 'a' is 'd'.
For i = 2, the 3rd character after 'r' is 'a'.
For i = 3, the 3rd character after 't' is 'r'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaa", k = 1
Output: "aaa"
Explanation:
As all the characters are the same, the encrypted string will also be the same.
