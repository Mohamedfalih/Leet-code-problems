Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

SOURCE CODE:

void reverseString(char* s, int sSize)
{
    int start = 0, end = sSize-1;
    while(start < end){
        char temp = s[start];
        s[start] = s[end];
        s[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
OUTPUT:

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
