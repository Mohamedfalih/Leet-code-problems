Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none)
of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

SOURCE CODE:

bool isSubsequence(char* s, char* t)
{
    int j=0;
    for(int i=0;j<strlen(s) && i<strlen(t);i++)
    {
       if(s[j]==t[i])
        j++;
    }
    return (j==strlen(s));
}
OUTPUT:
Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
