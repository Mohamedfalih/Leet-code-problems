You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.

SOURCE CODE:
char findTheDifference(char* s, char* t)
{
    int S=0,T=0;
    while (*s)
    {
        S += *s;
        s++;
    }
    while (*t)
    {
        T += *t;
        t++;
    }

    return (char)(T-S);  // (char) is optional
}
OUTPUT:

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
