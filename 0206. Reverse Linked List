Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

SOURCE CODE:

struct ListNode* reverseList(struct ListNode* head) 
{

    struct ListNode *prev = NULL;
    struct ListNode *current = head;
    struct ListNode *next = NULL;

    while (current != NULL) {
        next = current->next; 
        current->next = prev; 
        prev = current;        
        current = next;
    }
    return prev;
}
OUTPUT:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Input: head = []
Output: []
